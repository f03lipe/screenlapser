This script lets you record screenlapses by taking screenshots from time to
time and compiling them into an .avi video, with background music.

Yet another excuse to learn Bash (Bourn Again SHell). :)

## Requirements
- scrot (0.5 or above
- mencoder

## Usage:
$ ./screenlapser.sh working_dir [ record | count | compile | restart ] [-m bgmusic]?
